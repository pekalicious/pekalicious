Did you know that [http://lvh.me](http://lvh.me) resolves to `127.0.0.1` (AKA `localhost`)? This is particularly useful when developing locally websites that require subdomains. `http://sub.localhost` isn't an option, but `http://sub.lvh.me` is. Another option (waaaaay more memorable) is [http://localtest.me/](http://localtest.me/). 

I'm not sure who created lvh.me, my 20 seconds google didn't turn out anything, but localtest.me was created by [Scott Forsyth](https://weblogs.asp.net/owscott/introducing-testing-domain-localtest-me).
