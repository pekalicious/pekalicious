New year, new resolutions. Resolutions that, just like every year, will fall off a few months in! But why should that stop me?

<!-- more -->

So I thought I'd start... "microblogging". Is that still a word? Anyway, I've picked up Ruby (and particularly Ruby on Rails) over the holiday break and noticed that there are a lots (and I seriously mean LOTS) of small trial and errors througouht my journey. Many of them I forget how to solve, so started using post-it notes. But there are many more that I *might* need in the future, so a post-it note seems like wasted space. I do have [a blog](), but I reserve that for larger posts every now and then when all the stars in our solar system align. Hence, a new jekyll blog!

I've always wanted to tinker with Jekyll, and now that I'm learning Ruby it sounds like the right time. Learning Ruby in 2019 on the other hand, might not have been the best career move, but alas.

And thus Trial and Forget was born. A blog where I document (*Fire and Forget*) minor issues I've found and how I solved them while learning (*Trial and Error*) new technologies.

Let's see how my 5th attempt at blogging goes.
