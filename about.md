Hello there! This is a (micro)blog where I document every little challenge I have throughout my development day for me to remember and for you to possibly(?) learn.

The title is a combination of Trial and Error and Fire and Forget. The former being the method in which I learn new stuff while the latter the manner in which I write this blog.

I also post once or twice a decade at [https://pekalicious.com](https://pekalicious.com).
